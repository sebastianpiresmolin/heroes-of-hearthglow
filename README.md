# TEST RUNNING

## Before running any test you need to run:
`npm install`

## E2E - Cypress test

Firstly, Make sure that port:3000 is open, since it is the default port for this Next project and therefore the baseUrl for Cypress.
Then run:

`npm run build`
`npm run start`
`npm run cypress:open`

Now the Cypress client window should be opened for you. Press the E2E option and select the spec you want to run.
